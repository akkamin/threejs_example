# threejs_example

-note that the paths for the threejs and loader files are relative to the files that reference them, 
so if you move files around you will have to update paths

-example.zip is the zip file containing the project files

-human_only_low_poly_for_glb_export_that_works.zip is the blender file of the human model (sorry about the name)

note: this can only be run on a server, if you try to run in on your local computer some 
of the files will not be able to load due to cross referencing. 

-the glb file often gets messed up during transfer, 
especially if there is limited space on wherever this will be hosted. Unless the animation size is small
or there is a lot of space on the webserver, i do not recommend trying to load 3d glb models. 
This is more proof that it actually works sometimes it takes multiple uploads of the glb file
before it works. glb files can also be viewed at https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ to make sure they actually
work.

-landing_project2.html is the "homepage" 

-the argon_simulation is in the argon folder in the examples folder.
  
    -the argon_positions.js file is the way particle data is kept 
    (I am certain that is not the ideal way to handle that, but I couldn't  think of anything better)
   
    -the argon_json_to_array.js just converts the json array to a regular array

-the person running is in the examples folder.
  
    -the actual model is in the models/gltf folder
  
    -you can view glb files using a https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ 
    if you make your own to make sure they exported properly.
  
    -it took a while to figure out the exporting format in blender. 
    I also attached the blender file for refernece. 
    In order to view it you will need to download blender
    and install the gltf addon, links are in the landing page
