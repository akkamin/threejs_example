# threejs_example

-example.zip is the zip file containing the project files
-human_only_low_poly_for_glb_export_that_works.zip is the blender file of the human model (sorry about the name)

note: this can only be run on a server, if you try to run in on your local computer some of the files will not be able to load due to cross referencing. 

-landing_project2.html is the "homepage" 

-the argon_simulation is in the argon folder in the examples folder.
  -the argon_positions.js file is the way particle data is kept (I am certain that is not the ideal way to handle that, but I couldn't  think of anything better)
   -the argon_json_to_array.js just converts the json array to a regular array

-the person running is in the examples folder.
  -the actual model is in the models/gltf folder
  -you can view glb files using a https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ if you make your own to make sure they exported properly.
  -it took a while to figure out the exporting format in blender. I also attached the blender file for refernece.
